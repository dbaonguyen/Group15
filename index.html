I was born in Ha Noi and my hometown is Hai Duong. Currently, I am a first-year student at RMIT University. I consider myself a friendly and kind guy with several hobbies, such as playing football, listening to music, and playing video games. Apart from those hobbies, I like to study how computers and applications work in the IT world, and most importantly, I desire to become a back-end developer for a big company in the future. To reach that goal, I attended an Information Technology course at RMIT. However,  I am not a non-active person, so I always try to push myself to be more disciplined and concentrate on every task that I have to do. I had basic programming language knowledge, including Python, Java, and some HTML and CSS. In this project, I will play an important role in researching how our product will work and programming the conversion technique. I hope that by joining RMIT, I can expand my understanding of computers and how I can become an expert software engineer to develop my career path.</div>

Here’s a little something about myself. I was born and raised here in Hanoi. I’ve been here all my life. Even though I went abroad for a year, I find myself coming back here due to my strong connection to the city. During high school, I researched the topic of artificial intelligence - more specifically deep reinforcement learning. An article stumbled upon me about OpenAI’s Dota bots beating a professional esports team. It got me hooked. From there on I had a certain interest in machine learning and neural networking. Now I was given the opportunity to expand my horizons with a group of like-minded students to research and develop our own personal AI project which creates music through the use of images. My role will act as the main coder and gather credible sources for this project. You can contact me at s3927046@rmit.edu.vn.</div>

I have some experience in coding using C++ and Python along with some fundamental algorithms and currently working to further improve my coding skills. My hobbies are mostly gaming, mostly tactic-based. Other than that, I am also interested in facialogy because I believe there is more to see on a face, and I always look forward to any opportunity to widen my knowledge in this field. In this project, my main role is to manage the project’s status to make sure everything runs smoothly and be prepared for any problem that we may encounter during the journey. Aside from this role, I also research materials for the project and brainstorm ideas.
                                For contact information, you can always share your ideas, questions, etc…. via s3979411@rmit.edu.vn and I will make sure to reply in the next 24 hours(except on national holidays).</div>

I’m a friendly and nice guy but it is really hard for me to control my anger. I luckily had a chance to use computers at a young age and was soon fascinated by video games at that time. Since then, I have been interested in how games work and what are the keys to make applications like that. To answer that question, I decided to choose IT as my future career and I might get a chance to make my own game. In this project, I will be one of the main coders of the product. Moreover, I will have an opportunity to research and arrange the data in the product. Although I haven’t known much about IT, I believe I will have a better understanding of computers and how to be a programmer as my main career after joining RMIT. </div>

                                <p class="portfolio__description">In this project, our group will develop a neural network capable of designing for artists and movie makers deep learning certified and pre-selected image sets. While there have been similar existing services such as Mubert, Melobytes, Hugging Face, etc, these don't always provide the most accurate nor the most satisfying sounding music files. The movie and art industry will still highly value artistic vision over a mild facade that gives them mediocre performance. Thus, our aim here is to create a tool that’s not made to replace human artists and movie makers but an idea generator with its user at its core. 
                                    The signs for demands have shown a significant rise. According to OpenAI, there are more than 1.5 million sign up, and 2 million generated pictures each day using DALL-E alone (OpenAI, 2022).
                                    Despite the quality of a machine-made product being somewhat subpar based from image 1, it can be inferred that people are starting to incorporate the use of this technology in their daily lives. From this fact, we can infer that our objective for this is to improve the quality of and find methods to commercialise a product to a more targeted audience. Since we are aiming to create higher-quality AI-generated outputs for the user, a method needed to generate revenue is necessary. To do this, we will start out by putting out ads around our website to get the money needed to keep up with both the demands and maintenance to make sure everything stays running. Our final goal is to create a UI that’s easy to use and interactive while keeping a professional look for our target audience. </p>

                                <p class="portfolio__description">Based on the recent rise and trend in the development of Artificial Intelligence projects,  we decided to create this project out of curiosity. During the initial period of the semester, our researcher Dang has spotted a particular website named Mubert, a text to music website. After a session of discussion, we decided to attempt to bring the project to life as an image-to-music website. Opposed to popular beliefs, we believe that artificial intelligence should be a tool to help accelerate human performance and creativity. Thus, we decided to focus our project on the side of the creative industries. While there have been multiple AI websites that have been made for experimental purposes, G15 believes that the project should be made as professional tools in generating the first spark of ideas. This means that companies can bring their personal artworks and implement such works through a site that lifts off a lot of unnecessary expenses. Furthermore, Vietnam has a growing AI field filled with talented AI engineers. In an article by Samaya Dharmaraj from Vietnam Insider, she reported: “These activities have attracted a significant force from Vietnam’s fledgling human resources in this field. Meanwhile, the training of human resources in the AI area in Vietnam remains weak, in addition to having only a small number of people who can provide training in AI technology” (Dharmaraj, 2022). We hope to provide a space for such talent to be not wasted and hopefully be a place for future AI developers to come towards and provide the industry with the best of their skills.

                                <p class="portfolio__description">As mentioned before, our project isn’t the first of its kind to distribute music files to its users. There are a multitude of websites such as Hugging Face, Mubert, Voice Mod, and Melobytes. Hugging Face is a platform for AI developers to build/train machine learning open-source models. Because of the existence of Hugging Face’s open source community similar to GitHub, Mubert, Voice Mod, and Melobytes are potential competitors to rise and expand at an unpredictable pace. These websites came much before ours and their experiences within the field cannot be underestimated. Nevertheless, based on the success found in these 3 main competitors, we decided to take similar approaches to how these competitors develop their products from Hugging Face and differentiate them in our own ways. First of all, our project doesn’t turn text-to-music and instead uses image-to-music to differentiate ourselves from the market. In this way, we found a niche in the field to get users more interested in our product. Second of all, we allow multiple users to collaborate, change, add, train and store their files in dedicated storage. Currently, Mubert, Voice Mod, and Melobytes are only available for one user per device only. As our aim is to bring our project to the professional workforce, it’s essential to have collaboration features making us more desirable to professionals. Thirdly, we have a live service chatbox for those who're in need of help or want to provide constructive feedback on our project. This chatbox will provide us with certain details or improvements that our project needs and catch up to our competitors. </p>

                                <div class="portfolio__description">Initially, Dang and Bao met each other at a seminar and teamed up with each other. As Bao had previous connections with Khoi and Duy, our group was then quickly formed by the beginning of Week 1.  Despite never having worked together before, we have had a clear line of communication and understanding toward each other. During this time, Dang was playing around the Mubert website and we found a project that happened to match our interests and related to IT. As Week 2 arrives, we eventually got the hold of the idea for AI-generated music. However, during the majority of the first 4 weeks, we took the time to understand each other as individuals better outside of the project. We had minimal prior knowledge about artificial intelligence before even figuring out the first step. Nevertheless, this doesn’t stop us from taking a risk for an opportunity to broaden our horizons.</div>

                                <div class="portfolio__description">By giving each member of the team a specific role, we could figure out each person’s capability and share tasks based on what each is best at. However, everyone still has the right to choose what they want to do first, then the leftovers will be shared equally. This is a tactic that is commonly found in modern work environments where the emotional factor is considered in order to get the best result from everyone’s work while reducing the workload’s stress as much as possible. After the splitting is done, each member’s name with the tasks they received is recorded and published for everyone to access anytime to make sure that no one gets confused or mistakes one task for another. Specifically, Bao will manage our files and GitHub repository because he is quite familiar with Google Docs and similar services that support team working. Aside from that, he also works on the report parts that are related to the field’s market. Duy will take care of tasks that are quite emotion-oriented like reflection and functions based on users’ experience since we have noticed that he has a more outstanding ability in writing and thinking about emotion factors in our previous works. Dang on the other hand will take care of the interface and highlight the ideas of the real application’s mechanisms since he has some knowledge of machine learning and thus has a better idea on how technical particles will work. And last but not least, Khoi will write down the strategy of the project including what to be written in the report, what function must be available in the application and basically create a frame of the project so that no one gets confused with what and where to do while also taking part in writing and ensure that things are going on the right track.

                                <div class="portfolio__description">At the initial stage of our project, as discussed before, we mainly used most of our time to know about each other’s capabilities, skill levels, and personalities. G15 prioritises having effective collaboration and planning rather than moving on blindly with no clear goal or roles. Thus, We weren’t able to do any projects during this time. The progression begins once Week 4 & 5 start and our roles have been determined. The project went on smoothly for the most part until we hit a point where we’ve not considered the problem of us being overly ambitious. Eventually, we solved such an issue by steering our initial project in a different direction. The project proposal was the beginning of it all when we decided what we are going to work on the project. As mentioned before, we ran into a problem that the project was too hard for us to do so we had to change our plan. This was actually caused by a miscommunication when we thought the project proposal, the presentation and the report were about different projects so we let our imagination soar high and far. After the redirection, we focused mainly on the report and decided to make the app’s interface first so that we can at least present a clear goal of how we want the application to look like and what goals are there to be set for it. After having completed the report, we used its information to create our project website. Thanks to Bao, our website can be made with a better interface with some interesting features. As for the presentation, we have finished the slides before the report and written down a script to make sure that our parts can collaborate precisely.

                                <h3 class="portfolio__title">Realisation</h3>
                                <div class="portfolio__description">Although at first we drew out a sketch plan on how our application will work step by step along with resources and materials that can make each step come true but after further discussion and research, we have realised how far-fetched our idea is and that the project can not come to reality in the next few months. Because of this, a new decision was made and everyone agreed that instead of trying to create the AI, we will work on its interface first and put more effort into it so that when we get the AI, all that’s left is to put a completed interface onto it and everything will be ready to launch for the public to try. Other than that, we also spend more time on our report to ensure that the lecturers and perhaps future investors can see and understand the potential of our project which is very important to the project's success as well. Because we realised this early, there was no significant problem that we had to face and kept things under control. Since we are only first-year students, perhaps the idea of making an AI is still too much for us and we should just play safe for now.

                                <div class="portfolio__description">It would be a big boost to say that we did not find this assignment challenging at all. Since our knowledge was only at the surface level of the field, we got into difficulties while trying to code particles for the application and because of this we came to the decision of changing the main current goal and future plan of the project. Luckily, the new direction went on well with only a few minor difficulties, which were solely about team coordination and readjusting schedules to fit the new plan.  However, thanks to this we have learned how to work with each other more effectively as a team. Since we changed our aim to the interface’s design, everything went smoothly with the discussion and execution process.

First of all, the one memorable thing that I acknowledge is that Information Technology is not just a major that we only need to code, it is about how I understand how computers and technology work in terms of developing the world. Secondly, I realize that coding a  website is not an easy task for me to complete. However, thanks to my lecturer in this course and my teammates, I still manage to create a website that displays our project. Because this is a group project, teamwork is a very important skill to lead a project to become successful. Luckily, every member has experienced a lot of activities that include collaboration working before attending this course. As a result, I had no problem communicating with my group mates and collaborating well with them. Along with working with my team, I consider myself to have such great development including extending my knowledge of the IT business and improving useful skills like problem-solving and teamwork. By experiencing all of these, I believe that I will be able to further develop myself in future projects.

                            <p class="testimonial__description">During the duration of my first ever semester doing a group project, The performance and dedication of the group members deeply impressed me. I can stand on equal terms with them and learn to trust their abilities to do the necessary work. After this project, I understood the value of effective collaboration, communication, and teamwork. Despite that, problems still arise despite our strong preparations. Overestimating our capabilities, overlapping schedules of different classes' deadlines with each other, researching the right sources to understand machine learning models, and managing my inner emotions to reduce work stress were some examples that arose. Nevertheless, my team has given me words of encouragement to push me forward and succeed. We evenly distribute our work with each other and fill each other's weaknesses. As a result, I was able to accelerate my strength so I designed the group’s logo/UI prototype with Duy and Khoi. Khoi and I split out the work for project research. As Bao and Duy are skilled programmers and have worked with each other before, I trust them to build the group’s website. We proceed to deal with our listed sets of problems one by one. Even though our group may not be as impressive as other groups when it comes to visual presentation, I believe that G15 has done an exceptional job and puts our hearts where it really matters. This experience gets me excited to collaborate with more potential future partners and learn so many new skills.

                            <p class="testimonial__description">By working on this project, I have learned new things about the field, the tools and the people around me. At first, my impression of information technology is that all they do is coding on multiple platforms. However, by working on this assignment and the course as a whole, I have learned that IT is not just about coding but also about understanding things in life and finding out different approaches to a single subject. Also, before I thought all that people in this field have are coding environments and languages and that they can write codes solely with their accumulated knowledge. Thanks to the teaching of our lecturers, I have known about Stack Overflow and other coding platforms for everyone to share ideas and help each other. One more thing that gave me a whole new perspective is the people. My teammates are incredible and knowledgeable, to the point that I never expected someone at my age would know about these advanced knowledge. And the fact that they can cooperate with these different knowledge with each other to work on this project proved to me that even the things that I thought would be impossible to relate to a subject can still be of use in some way during the process. As for me, I have now understood more about the world of IT, AI and automation. Although my career choice does not necessarily need AI, this can still be an effective tool for my future work. This motivates me to study and research more into different fields of IT and even ones outside of the IT world.

I have learned a lot from my teammates while also striving to improve my soft and technical skills. As the person in charge of creating the website for this project, I had to do research and compile other people's ideas in order to develop such an incredible website. However, that was not a simple task for an IT freshman like me but Bao, the leading developer, has helped me with various coding errors in the website. I wish I had spent more time in self-study so that I did not have to disturb him lots of times. Additionally, I had a difficult time keeping up with our teammate's current process but with the help of my team, I quickly overcame that, and I was well-prepared for any tasks I was given. I was also surprised by how pleasant and professional the working environment was. I believe that one of the key components to the success of our project was that everyone was nice and respected other's opinions. As a result, we had a deeper understanding of one another and were able to help any team members who required it. It was a delight for me to work with such kind and nice teammates and I believe I improved myself more than I expected at the beginning.
